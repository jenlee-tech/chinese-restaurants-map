# Chinese restaurants in my neighborhood by Jennifer Lee

This is the 7th and final project of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree program.
The project entails creating a neighborhood map by using React. My topic of interest was creating a map with finding Chinese restaurants in the Hartford neighborhood.

## To get started:

- clone or download this repository in a folder.
- in a terminal such as Git Bash or Node, navigate to the same folder
- install all project dependencies by typing `npm install`
- start the development server by typing `npm start`
- project should open in browser at http://localhost:3000/

If you decide to work offline, the "create-react-app" feature was used to create this application - it includes a service worker in the production build. Therefore, it could only be used in the production build. The site will use a service worker to cache responses for site assets. Visited pages are rendered when the page is visited offline, then, you run these commands in a terminal:

- npm run build
- serve -s build

Then on your browser, visit http://localhost:5000/

## Dependancies:

## - Further thoughts:

After the last two projects, I really like React. I definitely will continue to create more projects with React. This project was built on lots of reading and drinking copious amounts of coffee. :coffee: :smile:
